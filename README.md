Curate is a "pure" engagement tool created to strengthen a user's relationship with its clients through a customer's diary. Users can build a full-fledged profile for their customers (or import their profiles from HubSpot), and keep track of their interactions via diary logs.
Curate.io was built to **discourage ineffective first contacts such as template sales emails, scripted phone calls, and cold LinkedIn messages, and encourage more authentic relations!**
